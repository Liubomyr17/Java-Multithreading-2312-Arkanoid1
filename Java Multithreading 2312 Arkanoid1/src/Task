2413 Arkanoid 1
Let's write the Arkanoid game today.
In the original, it looks something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th-Z6QQ5AOQ
To get started, we will write a simplified version of this game.
We will have cubes, a ball and a flying "stand", which prevents the ball from falling.
Therefore, we need classes:
a) Arkanoid - a class in which the main actions take place. It will also have our entry point into the program, the main method.
b) Ball - a ball.
c) Brick - "bricks" that we shoot down with a ball.
d) Stand - flying stand.
Create them and donâ€™t forget about the public static void main (String [] args) method in the Arkanoid class.

Requirements:
1. The Arkanoid class must be created in a separate file.
2. The Ball class must be created in a separate file.
3. The Brick class must be created in a separate file.
4. The Stand class must be created in a separate file.
5. The public static void main (String [] args) method must be created in the Arkanoid class.
